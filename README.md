Concrete-Wall
=============

Concrete Wall provides an activity feed block for concrete5.

This is the open-source, MIT-licensed version of the Concrete Wall (http://www.concrete5.org/marketplace/addons/concrete-wall-by-lerteco-developer-preview/).

Due to a lack of contributions to the source, coupled with support requests from users, I'm no longer actively supporting or upgrading the version on github, unlike the version for sale in the concrete5 marketplace. What this means is that I'm happy to leave this repository available for anyone who wants to use it, provide support as I'm able, and accept pull requests. But, generally, this will remain at the current version while the paid version will continue to be developed.
